# EAMin
# Enterprise Architecture Mining Project

This project consists of two main parts:
1. **Extraction of the Enterprise Architecture Knowledge Graph**
2. **Visualization of Enterprise Architecture Models**

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to extract and visualize Enterprise Architecture (EA) models using relevant data. The knowledge graphs of EA are extracted from event logs formats and then converted into an EA model for analysis and visualization.
